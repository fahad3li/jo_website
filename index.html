          I’m <strong>Julie Owens MP</strong>, your Labor Federal Member in the Australian Parliament. I am proud to have been elected by our community since 2004. I’m the Shadow Assistant Minister for Small Business, Citizenship and Multicultural Australia and, prior to my career in politics, I was a small-business owner and Head of the Association of Australian Independent Record Labels.<br><br>
          Parramatta is my home and I’m passionate about the strength and diversity of our community. I’m always looking for ways to support and facilitate the growth of the people of Parramatta.<br><br>
          As a young woman who grew up in public housing, my dream was realised when I was accepted into university, thanks to the Labor Government opening access to higher education for young people. Since then, I’ve helped deliver: increases in university enrolments among local young people, with more than 70% of current students able to proudly say they are the first in their family to go to university; brand new facilities for all our local schools; and better government services and facilities for the whole community.
          <br></br>There is so much more to do! The Turnbull Federal Government has introduced savage cuts to our public services, hurting our local community.
